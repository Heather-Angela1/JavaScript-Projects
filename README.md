# JavaScript-Projects
 JavaScript course repository

Hello there,

This is my repository for the JavaScript course I'm taking. Here, I'm submitting all the code and resources for the course assignments. I'm excited to learn more about JavaScript and improve my skills as a developer.

In this repository, you'll find various folders and files containing my code examples, exercises, and projects. I'm following along with the course and practicing what I learn by working through the exercises and building my own projects.

Throughout this course, I'm covering a wide range of topics, including variables, data types, functions, arrays, objects, loops, conditionals, and more. I'm also diving into more advanced topics such as DOM manipulation, event handling, AJAX, and jQuery.

I'm looking forward to developing a strong foundation in JavaScript and becoming a better developer. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.

Thanks for checking out my repository!
